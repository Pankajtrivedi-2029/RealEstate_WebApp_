I developed a **MERN-based real estate application** with **Prisma and MongoDB** for efficient database management, ensuring structured and scalable data handling. The app provides a seamless platform for **property listings, searches, and user interactions** in the real estate domain.  

For **authentication**, I implemented **JWT-based authentication with cookies**, enabling secure user login and session management. **Context API** was used for efficient state management, ensuring smooth data flow across the application, while **React Router DOM** handled client-side routing for a dynamic and responsive user experience.  

Real-time updates and communication were made possible using **Socket.io**, enabling features like instant property status updates and live chat between buyers and sellers. The **Prisma ORM** streamlined database interactions with **MongoDB**, making queries more structured and efficient.  

With a **modern UI/UX**, this full-stack app delivers a robust experience for users to browse, list, and manage properties seamlessly. The project showcases expertise in **full-stack development, real-time communication, authentication, and efficient database handling**, making it a scalable and user-friendly solution for the real estate market.
